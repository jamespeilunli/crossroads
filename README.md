# Crossroads

ChatGPT-powered chatbot supporting multiple conversation paths

Very WIP. Currently has just a Python CLI.

## Running the CLI

### Setup

Write a .env with your OpenAI API key in it:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Run with a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Use Ctrl+C to quit the program.

Leave the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
